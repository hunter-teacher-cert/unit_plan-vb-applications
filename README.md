# Procedures in Visual Basic
by Michael Randazzo

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
This unit will be the unit directly following units that cover how to use variables, conditionals in an Intro to Computer Science class. This unit will not introduce new topics but will rather allow students to create projects that will make use of each of those objects and studctures in different combinations. Due to the event driven design of Visual Basic. The projects students will create will be intended for user interaction.

### Motivation for Unit
The motivaiton for this unit is to create a reason for students to use and develop a deeper understanding of each of the main data structures covered earlier. A core concept for an intro to cs class is to given students foundational knowledge of conditionals, variables and basic functions and the best way to develop that understanding is to use those topics to create something. This unit really allows students to solve complex problems on their own or in small groups by developing a process. Time will be spent first break down the elements of the assignment into a few sections and developing pseudocode and then finally making the project. The projects will also allow students to see what loops can do based on the user based project design.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

9-12.CT.4 Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

9-12.CT.5 Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.

9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

9-12.CT.9 Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

9-12.CT.10 Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.
